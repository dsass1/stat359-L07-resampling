## Overview

The goal for this lab is to start using resampling methods to compare models. Ultimately leading to the selection of a final/winning/best model.

This lab covers material up to and including [11. Comparing models with resampling (11.2)](https://www.tmwr.org/compare.html) from [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/).

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L07_resampling.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L07.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
